Initial state : No queens are placed in any row i.e, empty vector

State space : Each queen can be placed in any row of a particular column, since no two queens are allowed in the same column. So number of states = 8^8

State transition operators : A new queen can be placed in anyone of the rows (from 0 to 7) of a column (0-index based rows and colums)

Goal state : All queens are at non-attacking positions

Cost : Cost of a final goal depends on the number of steps it took to reach it.
